## hadome

This repository uses hadome to stop regressions in code and tests.

- Before you finish any change, run `hadome check --format json` and fix every regression it reports.
- Exit codes: `0` done · `1` regression, fix it · `2` configuration error, fix the configuration · `3` a person must review (a new exception, a loosened configuration, code that stopped being pure, or something hadome could not identify). On `3`, stop and ask. Never change the code just to make it pass.
- When you ask about `3`, give what hadome listed (the rule and its `why`), why you made that change, and the other way you would take if it is not accepted, with what that costs. Leave the decision to the person; do not tell them it is fine.
- Never add `gate:allow` to get a check to pass. Add one only when the rule truly does not apply, with a specific reason, and tell the person.
- When a test guards a product-specific invariant, add `guards: <id>` to its doc comment; for `durable`, `erasable`, `append-only` and `fail-closed`, add `guards: <type> <target>`. `idempotent`, `round-trip` and `isolated` are recognised from the test's calls. `hadome explain invariants` lists them.
- When `hadome check` lists invariant candidates and one covers behaviour that matters, propose it to the person instead of adding it yourself.
- Before changing `.hadome.yml`, run `hadome explain <key>`. After changing it, run `hadome config check`.
